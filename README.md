Trying to clear Vtiger6 Issues

Vtiger6 has bugs and missing modules.  I am trying to solve some of those problems and also looking into creating the missing modules.  This way, I hope to be able to complement a good product with open source additions.  Currently, Vtiger team seems to have opted for going against open source.  I would like to make sure that this product will continue and live as open source.
